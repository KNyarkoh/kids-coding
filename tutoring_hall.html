Our mathematics program focuses on underserved students who are generally underperforming in their grade math.  Their arithmetic is unreliable, fractions rudimentary, 
they have a weak understanding of decimals, no facility with expressions and no number sense. Our tool is to prepare these students to excel in mathematics before entering 
college.  This means re-teaching these students Algebra I and II, complete the 8th-grade Common 
Core curriculum and be able to get 700 out of 800 on the mathematics component of the SAT exam - in 8th-grade
